I'm a Part-Time Creator and Fullstack developer, I'm currently looking for an end year internship.
I create various types of content across [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mohamedsalbi),   and this blog about **building IT businesses and production-ready apps and some of my hobbies.**


## Why I'm doing these in public?

- Sharing is caring , someone might learn from my experience
and not fall into the same pitfalls I did.

## What can you find here?

Blogs, tips, and discussions. About building and learning 
a lot of different things i'm passionate about.

**My background as a Software Engineer:** I create user-centered web and
mobile applications using cutting-edge technologies like React Native, Flutter,
GraphQL, and ESNext for almost 5 years. I love to learn new things by experimenting
with state-of-the-art technologies (mostly JS-related).

**My background as a guitar player:**
When it comes to music i believe that the guitar is the most versatile instrument and i love to play it. I've been playing guitar for 10 years and i'm still learning new things everyday.

**My background as a Philosopher:** 
I read a lot of psychology and philosophy books and i'm always trying to understand the human mind and how it works. I'm also a big fan of Doestoyevsky and Nietzsche.
